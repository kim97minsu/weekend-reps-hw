III. Arrays & Control Flow

A. Talk about it: 
1. Inside the arrays are elements and each elements can be of any type. such as string, boolean, objects, or even arrays. 
2. No
3. A description of a city, including name, population size, name of the mayor, what county, etc.

B. Easy Does It
1. let quotes = [ "first", "second", "third"]

C. Accessing elements 
1. randomThing[0]
2. randomThing[2] = "World" 

D. Change values 
1. ourClass[2]
2. ourClass[4] = "Octocat"
3. ourClass.push("Cloud City")

E. Mix It Up
1. myArray.push("Egon")
2. myArray.push("String")
3. myArray.unshift("Bob Marley")
4. myArray.pop()
5. With .reverse(), I mutated the array by returning a reversed order of the array.
